# FaceRecognition

Base model from Scratch


Working :

# Recognise Faces using some classification algorithm - like Logistic, KNN, SVM etc.


# 1. load the training data (numpy arrays of all the persons)
		# x- values are stored in the numpy arrays
		# y-values we need to assign for each person
# 2. Read a video stream using opencv
# 3. extract faces out of it
# 4. use knn to find the prediction of face (int)
# 5. map the predicted id to name of the user 
# 6. Display the predictions on the screen - bounding box and name
